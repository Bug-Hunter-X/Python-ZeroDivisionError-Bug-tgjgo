This repository contains a simple Python function that demonstrates a common error: division by zero. The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version with proper error handling.  The error occurs when the function attempts to divide by zero, leading to a `ZeroDivisionError`. The solution demonstrates how to gracefully handle such situations using a `try-except` block.
